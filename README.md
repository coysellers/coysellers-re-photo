# Coy Sellers Real Estate Photo

Hi üëãüèª, my name is Coy. I'm a software developer and photographer located in Nashville, TN. I'm building this website to create a web presence for the Real Estate portion of my photography portfolio, as well as to practice building API's, a React app, and implementing TypeScript.
